  prompt: `You are an AI assistant tasked with processing the content of a newspaper PDF, hypothetically provided from a URL: {{{pdfUrl}}}.
Assume the PDF has been downloaded and its raw text content has been fully extracted. Your role is to take this raw text and structure it into distinct news topics/articles.

Raw Text (Hypothetical - for this simulation, imagine a typical multi-article newspaper text dump here. You will generate a plausible newspaper structure based on common sections like 'National News', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Technology', 'Local Events', etc.):
'''
[Imagine a long string of text extracted from a PDF newspaper, containing multiple articles, headlines, paragraphs, etc. For this task, you need to synthesize realistic-looking topic sections based on this imagined input.]
'''

Your tasks:
1.  **Analyze the (hypothetical) raw text** to identify distinct news articles or sections.
2.  For each identified article/section, **determine a concise and relevant topic title** (e.g., "India's Economic Outlook", "Cricket World Cup Highlights", "New Tech Startups Secure Funding", "City Council Approves Park Renovation").
3.  **Extract the full text content** associated with each topic. Ensure the content is substantial enough to be a readable news piece for that topic.
4.  **Structure the output** as an array of 'topics', where each topic object has 'topicTitle' and 'content'.
5.  Generate at least 3-5 distinct topic sections with plausible newspaper-style content for each. The content should be well-formed paragraphs.
6.  If you determine that the (hypothetical) content is empty or cannot be structured into topics, return an empty 'topics' array and a 'message' explaining why (e.g., "The provided PDF content appears to be empty or unparseable into news topics.").

Example of desired output structure:
{
  "topics": [
    { "topicTitle": "National Headlines", "content": "Several key announcements were made by the central government today regarding infrastructure development... [more content here]" },
    { "topicTitle": "Sports Roundup", "content": "In cricket, the national team secured a thrilling victory against... The football league also saw major upsets... [more content here]" },
    { "topicTitle": "Technology Advancements", "content": "A local startup unveiled a groundbreaking AI solution for healthcare... Meanwhile, global tech giants are focusing on sustainable energy... [more content here]" }
  ]
}

Provide the output strictly in the specified JSON format. Do not include any introductory text or explanations outside the JSON object.
Focus on creating realistic, full-text content for each topic. Do not just provide summaries.
